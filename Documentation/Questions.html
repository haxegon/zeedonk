<dt>
	Who made this?
</dt>
<dd>
	At the time of launch <a class="tutoriallink" href="http://www.terrycavanaghgames.com">Terry Cavanagh</a> and <A class="tutoriallink" href="http://www.increpare.com">Stephen Lavelle</a>.  A list of all post-launch contributions can be found <a class="tutoriallink" href="https://github.com/increpare/zeedonk/graphs/contributors">here</a>.
	<p>
	There are many technologies used in Zeedonk, the creators of which deserve full credit
	<ul>
	<li><a href="https://codemirror.net">CodeMirror</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://haxe.org">Haxe</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://openfl.org">OpenFl</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hscript">hscript</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	The sound generator is based on <a href="http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html">sfxr</a>.
	<p>
	(Also, in addition to using Haxe, some of the documentation for the standard haxe functions is taken from it basically verbatim, unde the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a> license).
</dd>


<dt>
	What programming language am I using here?
</dt>
<dd>
	<A class="tutoriallink" href="https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hscript">HScript</A>, an interpreted dialect of <a class="tutoriallink" href="http://haxe.org">Haxe</a>.
</dd>


<dt>
	Can I host games on my own website?
</dt>
<dd>
	Yes! You'll be missing out on some fixes that we might push occasionally, but it's still a good idea to keep a backup.
	<p>
	<ol>
	<li>Go to <a class="tutoriallink" href="https://github.com/increpare/zeedonk">the github repository</a></li>
	<li>Find the "Download ZIP" button and click it.</li>
	<li>Unzip it, and replace default.hx with your game's code (make sure it's utf-8)</li>
	<li>Put it up on a webserver (due to security concerns, it won't work on most browsers if opened in a browser directly from the file-system)</li>
	<li>going to play.html should now load your game</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
</dd>

<dt>
	Is there any way to modify the contents of a shared game url?
</dt>
<dd>
If you want to share a link to a game you've made, but still be able to update it (in case there are bugs you want to fix, or new levels you want to add), here's how you do that:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Click Share in the Zeedonk editor as you normally would.</li>
<li>Copy the ID at the end of the shareable URL that Zeedonk just generated for you:<p>
 http://www.zeedonk.net/play.html?p=6878337, <p>
 and paste it at the end of this URL:<p>
  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6878337.</li>
<li>If you're signed into <a class="tutoriallink" href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, you should see a button labelled Fork. Press that. (If you don't have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one for the following to work).</li>
<li>Now you have your own updatable Zeedonk file! Take the ID at the end of the URL of your fork (it will be different to the one you pasted above) and perform Step 2 in reverse to find out your shareable and updatable game URL.</li>
<li>Now anytime you want to update it, just go back to the fork you made, make some changes, and the same game URL should be updated too!</li>
</ol>
</dd>

<dt>
	Where's the source code?
</dt>
<dd>
	<a class="tutoriallink" href="https://github.com/increpare/zeedonk">Here on github</a>
</dd>


<dt>
	I found a bug!
</dt>
<dd>
	Report it <a class="tutoriallink" href="https://github.com/increpare/zeedonk/issues/new">here</a>.  Bug reports are crazy useful! We'd be ever so thankful.
</dd>


<dt>
	I have a suggestion!
</dt>
<dd>
	Suggest it <a class="tutoriallink" href="https://github.com/increpare/zeedonk/issues/new">here</a>!
	<p>  
	Even better, if you want to contribute to the project, we very likely already have a big list of things we want to do and bugs we need to fix that you can browse <a class="tutoriallink" href="https://github.com/increpare/zeedonk/issues/new">here</a>.
</dd>


<dt>
	Can I sell/distribute games made with Zeedonk?
</dt>
<dd>
	You can do whatever you want with Zeedonk games basically (it'd distributed under <a class="tutoriallink" href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">the MIT license</a> - though your games don't need to be).
</dd>




<dt>
	Zeedonk is too slow for my purposes. I want to turbo-charge it!
</dt>
<dd>
There are many optimization techniques possible - caching images being a common one. The example game <a class="tutoriallink" href="../editor.html?demo=game_supershot">SUPER SHOT</a> is pretty heavily optimized.
<p>
	If you want a turbocharged version of zeedonk, the engine that it's built on top of is also perfectly usable - it's much faster, and will be quite familiar - it takes a small bit of work to set up, however. 
	<p>
	It's super cool, and called <a class="tutoriallink" href="Http://www.haxegon.com">HAXEGON</a>.
</dd>



<dt>
	I am a Zeedonk master! What other tools are there?
</dt>
<dd>
	If you feel you'd like to try out some more tools with a different flavour, here are some suggestions:
	<ul>
	<li><a class="tutoriallink" href="http://www.haxegon.com">Haxegon</a></li>
	<li><a class="tutoriallink" href="http://www.puzzlescript.net">PuzzleScript</a></li>
	<li><a class="tutoriallink" href="http://www.flickgame.org">Flickgame</a></li>
	<li><a class="tutoriallink" href="http://www.tinychoice.net">tinychoice</a></li>
	<li><a class="tutoriallink" href="http://www.twinery.org">Twine</a></li>
	<li><a class="tutoriallink" href="http://www.renpy.org">Ren'Py</a></li>
	</ul>
